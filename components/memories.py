# HW3DDR4 models a 1 GiB dual channel DDR4 DRAM memory with a data
# bus clocked at 2400MHz. This model extends ChanneledMemory from gem5's
# standard libary. Please refer to
#     gem5/src/python/gem5/components/memory/memory.py
# for documentation on ChanneledMemory.

# Below is the function signature for the constructor of ChanneledMemory class.
